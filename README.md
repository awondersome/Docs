### git pull 出错
Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref 'refs/heads/master' from the remote, but no such ref was fetched.
你的配置指定与来自远程的ref合并，但没有ref被请求

#### git status 
On branch master
Your branch is based on 'origin/master', but the upstream is gone.
  (use "git branch --unset-upstream" to fixup)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
